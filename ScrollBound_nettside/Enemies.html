                <h4>Aethelgard is not a risen corpse or a man. It achieved <span class="no-text-shadow">██████</span>, <span class="no-text-shadow">██ █ ██ ████ █████ ████</span>. Visually, it manifests as a towering, asymmetrical spire of calcified, dark-grey bone, laced with pulsating veins of sickly necrotic light. It doesn't move so much as shift, grinding and cracking the floor with every ponderous step. </h4>
                <h4>Instead of a head, its central mass is dominated by the titular <span class="no-text-shadow">████</span>-<span class="no-text-shadow">██████</span>: a gaping, silent void where thousands of ghostly, flickering blue and green faces are permanently sealed, swirling like a slow-moving, <span class="text-tooltip" title="Meaning: something that seems evil, threatening, or likely to cause harm">sinister</span> galaxy. This void is where it draws and holds the essence of every soul that falls within the cursed lands.</h4>
                <h4>Legend says Aethelgard was the ritual core of a forgotten necromantic civilization. It wasn't built; it grew from the single, cataclysmic act of anchoring an entire city's <span class="no-text-shadow">████ ██ ██████</span> to the material world. It is the permanent sinkhole of spirit energy, the reason death in your game world is never truly final, and the source of all the spreading corruption. To defeat Aethelgard is not just to kill a boss, but to re-release the primordial energy of the dead and lift the curse from the land.</h4>	
                <h4>The Obfuscating Truth: The <span class="no-text-shadow">████-██████</span> does not just draw in the spirits of the dead; it actively erodes the fabric of knowledge relating to its own existence. Any document, carving, or historical record that bears the name Aethelgard or describes the <span class="no-text-shadow">█████████ ███████</span>+ becomes increasingly corrupted.and ultimately ending's existance</h4>
                <h4>The letters twist, the ink fades and bleeds, and the text itself seems to "shift" before the eyes, becoming almost painfully difficult to read and comprehend—as if the document is actively fighting the reader's understanding. Scholars who dedicate themselves to its history often go mad.</h4>

This doesn't deal damage directly, but every low-tier undead (like Shambling Corpses) currently on the field is instantly healed and permanently empowered, gaining a damage and speed buff.

The only weak point is the glowing necrotic veins that pulse across its surface; the player must wait for these veins to temporarily <span class="text-tooltip" title="Meaning: an excessive amount of something">overload</span> and flash purple before dealing significant damage.</h5>
