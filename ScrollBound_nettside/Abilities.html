            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Description:</span> The character releases a burst of pure magical energy in a radius around them. </p>
            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect:</span> This ability deals moderate damage to all enemies within a short range and briefly interrupts their actions, making it an excellent <span class="bold">'panic button'</span> when surrounded. It also has a chance to <span class="bold">shatter enemy armor</span>, inflicting a temporary defense debuff on the affected foes.</p>

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect:</span> This is primarily <span class="bold">a defensive and positional</span> tool, allowing the player to quickly escape a dangerous situation or reposition behind a slow-moving enemy. Using it leaves behind a faint shimmering residue that momentarily <span class="bold">slows enemies</span> who touch it, granting a slight tactical advantage upon arrival.</p>

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>For a very brief period (e.g., 1-2 seconds), the shield <span class="bold">absorbs all incoming damage</span> from the front direction and makes the character immune to knockback. When the shield expires, the stored kinetic energy is released as a <span class="bold">small cone-shaped wave </span>that can <span class="bold">stun or knock back </span>nearby enemies, creating space for the player.</p>

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>The initial hit deals high damage to a single enemy. More importantly, it applies a <span class="bold">'Cursed Mark' </span>debuff; for the next few seconds, all subsequent damage the enemy takes from any source is increased by a small percentage, making it crucial for <span class="bold">boss fights </span>or focusing down priority targets.</p>

             <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>The next time the player damages an enemy, that enemy has a <span class="bold">guaranteed chance to drop extra gold or a small shard of a rare crafting material </span>upon defeat, even if they don't normally drop anything. This ability is useful for <span class="bold">resource management </span>and maximizing runs by boosting the in-game economy.</p>

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>This ability creates a small AoE (Area of Effect) on the floor that <span class="bold">pulls nearby lesser enemies towards its center </span>for a short duration, effectively <span class="bold">grouping them up </span>for a follow-up attack. While active, the vortex deals continuous minor damage to anything caught inside, but its true value is the powerful <span class="bold">crowd control </span>it provides.</p>

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>Rips a fragment of spirit from the nearest corpse (or sacrifices 5% of your current HP if no corpse is nearby) to summon a <span class="bold">Skeletal Servant. </span>The servant has low health, lasts for 6 seconds, and primarily functions as an <span class="bold">aggro magnet </span>to distract enemies and absorb a few hits.</p>

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Description: </span>Imbues your equipped weapon (sword, axe, bow) with forgotten power. For the next <span class="bold">4 seconds, </span>your attacks apply a stacking debuff called <span class="bold">Decay. </span>Stacks of Decay deal small damage over time, and if an enemy reaches 5 stacks, they are briefly <span class="bold">Stunned </span>as their body momentarily collapses.</p>
            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>The equipped weapon emits a quick, hot <span class="bold">pulse of deep violet light, </span>and its sprite momentarily has a flickering purple aura.

You dash rapidly forward up to 5 tiles, becoming <span class="bold">Completely Invulnerable </span>to all damage for the duration of the dash. However, after exiting the shroud, you suffer a <span class="bold">2-second movement speed penalty.</span></p>
            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>The character's sprite dissolves instantly into a flurry of <span class="bold">fast-moving dark grey pixels and swirling grave dirt. </span>A ghostly, distorted echo of the character flashes across the dash path.</p>

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Description: </span>A directed burst of dark energy that deals low-to-moderate damage to the first enemy struck. <span class="bold">50% of the damage dealt is immediately returned to the player as health, </span>but the ability's mana cost is slightly higher than average, requiring calculated use.</p>
            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>A thick, directed <span class="bold">stream of swirling crimson and black smoke </span>shoots from the player's hand toward the enemy.

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Description: </span>Smashes a vial of putrescent ichor, creating a 3-tile wide pool of contagion at your target location. Enemies standing in the pool take moderate damage per second and are afflicted with <span class="bold">Sickness, </span>which reduces their damage output by 15% for 3 seconds after they leave the area.</p>
            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect: </span>A glass vial shattering sound is heard as a pool of <span class="bold">sickly yellow-green liquid </span>spreads across the ground, bubbling slowly. Small, dark fly sprites buzz visually above the contaminated area.</p>

            <p class="ability-text"><span class="bold">Effect:</span> This ability applies a heavy <span class="bold">Slow</span> effect to all enemies caught within its growing radius, reducing their movement and attack speed to near-zero. After a brief delay, the field detonates, dealing high <span class="bold">damage</span> and potentially applying a <span class="bold">Stun</span>, allowing the player to reposition or execute a follow-up attack on immobilized foes.</p>
